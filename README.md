# Kaprekar-Numbers
Outputs a list of Kaprekar numbers starting from 1 up to variable 'range', using tcl as scripting language...

It's probably not the most elegant solution in tcl, it might not even be mathematically correct, but the output is consistent with the expected list of numbers. Tested only up to a range of 10000, takes about 1..2 seconds to finish outputting the numbers on command line. I have created this code for the sake of completeness, since there are many alternatives in other, more popular, programming languages on GitHub. I was curious if I could do this in tcl as it was not done before. Well, at least not in any source I am aware of, such as tcl/tk wiki or GitHub for that matter. Be my guest to improve it and reshare it on GitHub.
